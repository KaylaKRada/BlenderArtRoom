🎨 Project Overview
This project is a 3D-rendered Art Room designed in Blender as part of my Independent Study course. I wanted to create a cozy, personalized creative space that feels both artistic and lived-in—full of color, natural lighting, and subtle details.

The goal was to learn and demonstrate core Blender skills like object modeling, material texturing, lighting, composition, and rendering. Every object in the room, from canvases and brushes to furniture and windows, was placed with intention, aiming for both aesthetic appeal and a sense of realism.

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
Blender 3D (modeling, lighting, rendering)

Object creation using meshes, modifiers, and loop cuts

Applied textures and materials (PBR shaders, UV mapping)

Lighting techniques using area lights and HDRI

Camera placement and depth-of-field

Rendered in Cycles with optimized sample settings

🧩 C.C.A.R.R. Breakdown
Challenge
Build a fully furnished 3D art room using Blender with custom lighting and object arrangement, without relying on prebuilt templates or tutorials.

Context
This was completed for an Independent Study course to explore Blender as a creative tool, while expanding my technical skill set in digital design.

Action

Sketched layout ideas before jumping into Blender

Modeled walls, floors, furniture, and art supplies

Added lighting to simulate a warm, sunny day with window shadows

Adjusted materials for realism (fabric on the chair, wood floor grain, etc.)

Rendered multiple angles and made refinements

Result
Produced a clean, aesthetically pleasing art room with thoughtful lighting and composition. The final renders capture a peaceful, artistic atmosphere and showcase fundamental 3D modeling and environmental design skills.

Reflection
This project was a fun way to express my creativity while learning a new technical tool. I gained hands-on experience with Blender's workflow and became more confident in 3D layout, lighting, and rendering. I’d love to create more interactive scenes or animated walkthroughs in future projects.
