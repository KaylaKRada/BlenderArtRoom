🧱 Blender Art Room
**Course:** Independent Study
**Created by:** Kayla Rada  

---

## 🎨 Project Overview
For this independent study, I wanted to challenge myself by learning something completely new. So I picked Blender, a powerful 3D modeling and rendering tool that artists and developers alike rave about.

My goal? Build my dream art room from scratch. Combining my love for art and technology in one cozy, creative space. I imagined a room I’d love to be in: warm sunlight streaming in, scattered paint supplies, half-finished canvases, a comfy chair, and soft pastel lighting. This wasn’t just about the final render—it was about seeing how far I could push myself in a new medium.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
- Blender 3D (modeling, lighting, rendering)
- Mesh modeling from primitives like cubes, planes, and cylinders
- Hotkeys and shortcuts for efficient editing
- PBR materials and UV texturing
- Manual lighting setup using HDRI and area lights
- Camera positioning, depth-of-field, and composition
- Rendered using Cycles for realism

## 🚗 CCARR Breakdown (Challenge, Context, Action, Result, Reflection)

### 🔹 **Challenge / Context**
Learn Blender from scratch and build a fully furnished 3D art room using only primitive shapes. No prebuilt assets or drag-and-drop tools.

### 🔧 **Action**
- Explored Blender’s interface and learned hotkeys through trial, error, and tutorials
- Built every object from scratch using cubes, cylinders, and planes
- Example: A paintbrush started as a cylinder, which I squished at one end, added a circle to create the brush tip, and then manually shaped it into a believable form
- Created realistic textures and materials from scratch
- Designed a natural light setup to simulate late afternoon sun
- Framed multiple camera angles and rendered the final images

### ✅ **Result**
The result is a soft, welcoming art space that feels real and personal. Everything in the scene was handcrafted. No shortcuts, just lots of learning, mistakes, and wins along the way.

### 💭 **Reflection**
I could have picked anything for this project, but I intentionally chose Blender to grow my creative and technical skills. While I didn’t have time to get into animation, this gave me a strong foundation in 3D modeling and rendering. I’m proud of how far I got, and I’d love to explore animated scenes or interactive models in the future.
